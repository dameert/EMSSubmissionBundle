# Supported handlers

## Configuration of a handler
In the backend a content type is defined to configure your submit procedure. The handler has access to the complete form data, and to the response of the previously defined submit handler. When multiple submit handlers are attached to a form instance, they are called in order of definition, and the result of the previous submission handler is passed to the next one.
More info about this concept can be found in the EMSFormBundle's "[Handle Submitted data](https://github.com/ems-project/EMSFormBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/handlers.md)" section.

A handler has 3 parts in the backend:
